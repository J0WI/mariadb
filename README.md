This is the Git repository of the [Docker "Official Image"](https://github.com/docker-library/official-images#what-are-official-images) for [`mariadb`](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/) (not to be confused with any official `mariadb` image provided by MariaDB Corporation). See [the Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/) for the full README on how to use this Docker image and for information regarding contributing and issues.

The [full image description on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb/) is generated/maintained over in [the docker-library/docs repository](https://github.com/docker-library/docs), specifically in [the `mariadb` directory](https://github.com/docker-library/docs/tree/master/mariadb).

## FAQ

**How do I reset my password?**

[One useful way](https://github.com/MariaDB/mariadb-docker/issues/365#issuecomment-816367940) to do this is to create an `initfile.sql` file that contains (to cover all bases) something like the following:

```sql
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS root@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'thisismyrootpassword';
SET PASSWORD FOR root@localhost = PASSWORD('thisismyrootpassword');
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO root@localhost WITH GRANT OPTION;
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS root@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'thisismyrootpassword';
SET PASSWORD FOR root@'%' = PASSWORD('thisismyrootpassword');
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO root@'%' WITH GRANT OPTION;
CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS myuser@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'thisismyuserpassword';
SET PASSWORD FOR myuser@'%' = PASSWORD('thisismyuserpassword');
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS databasename;
GRANT ALL ON databasename.* TO myuser@'%';
```
